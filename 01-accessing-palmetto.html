<p>In this workshop, we will use a command-line interface to interact with the Palmetto cluster, which runs the Linux operating system specifically, <a href="https://www.scientificlinux.org/">Scientific Linux</a>. However, note that these commands can be used on any <em>Unix-based</em> operating system, including Mac OS X.</p>
<p>To be able to run commands on the Palmetto from your own machine, you will first need to be able to log in to the Palmetto. This is known as a <em>remote login</em>. If you run Mac OS X or any other Unix-based operating system on your machine, you can log in remotely by opening a terminal and using the <code>ssh</code> command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ssh</span> username@user.palmetto.clemson.edu</code></pre></div>
<p>If you run Windows, you will use the SSH Secure Shell to log in. Click on <code>File &gt; Quick Connect</code>, and use the following parameters (whichever required):</p>
<ul>
<li>Host name: <code>user.palmetto.clemson.edu</code><br />
</li>
<li>User name: Clemson username<br />
</li>
<li>Port number: 22<br />
</li>
<li>Authentication method: none specified</li>
</ul>
<p>When logged in, you are presented with a welcome message and the following “prompt”:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">[<span class="kw">username@user001</span> ~]$ </code></pre></div>
<p>The prompt in a bash shell usually consists of a dollar (<code>$</code>) sign, and shows that the shell is waiting for input. The prompt may also contain other information: this prompt tells you your username and which node you are connected to - <code>user001</code> is the “login” node. It also tells you your current directory, i.e., <code>~</code>, which, as you will learn shortly, is short for your <em>home</em> directory. We will mostly refer to the prompt as just <code>$</code>, i.e.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ </code></pre></div>

<p>The Palmetto cluster has several “compute” nodes that can perform fast calculations on large amounts of data. To see what kind of compute nodes are available and which ones are free, use the <code>whatsfree</code> command:</p>

<p>It also has a few so-called “service” nodes, that are <em>not</em> meant for computation. Instead, they are meant to help users perform other actions such as transfering code and data to and from the cluster.</p>
<p>The most important of these “service” nodes is the login node <code>user001</code>. The login node runs a “server” program that listens for remote logins. On our own machines, we run a “client” program (Secure Shell or <code>ssh</code>) that can talk to this server. Our client program passes our login credentials to this server, and if we are allowed to log in, the server runs a shell for us on the computer it is running on (<code>user0001</code>). Any commands that we enter into this shell are executed not by our own machines, but by <code>user0001</code>.</p>
<p>Another important service node on the Palmetto cluster is the <em>scheduler</em> node. The scheduler decides which users can run their computations on the cluster and when. Different HPC clusters use different schedulers, which may be suited for different kinds of computations - currently, we run the PBS Professional (version 13.1) scheduler on the cluster.</p>
<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<p>There are three primary locations on the palmetto cluster that you can store code and data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Your home directory (<code>/home/username</code>). This is where you are placed when you log in to the cluster. You can have up to 100 GB of backed-up data here. Use the <code>checkquota</code> command to see how much space you are using:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">checkquota</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>/home/username:       23.6 GB of 100.0 GB; or 416,085 of 1,000,000 files</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Your scratch directories (<code>/scratch1/username</code> and <code>/scratch2/username</code>). Here, you can store virtually unlimited data - but it won’t be backed up, and can disappear at any time. As a matter of policy, files untouched for more than 30 days will be deleted. The scratch directories are meant to be temporary “work” spaces for your computations.</li>
</ol>
