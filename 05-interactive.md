The Palmetto cluster consists of several hundred "compute" nodes,
each equipped with CPUs and GPUs to do heavy computation.
The login node `user001` is a "service" node,
shared by all users,
and is meant only for tasks such as managing projects
(editing and moving files and directories),
and submitting batch scripts (about which we will learn shortly).

The file `/etc/hardware-table` lists the resources
available on the Palmetto cluster.

~~~{.bash}
$ cat /etc/hardware-table

PBS resource requests are always lowercase

(0) CHIP has 3 resources:   chip_manufacturer, chip_model, chip_type
(1) Leave 2GB for the operating system when requesting memory in PBS jobs
(2) Specify queue "bigmem" to access the large memory machines
(3) 2 NVIDIA Tesla M2075 cards per node, use resource request "ngpus=[1|2]" and "gpu_model=m2075"
(4) 2 NVIDIA Tesla K20m  cards per node, use resource request "ngpus=[1|2]" and "gpu_model=k20"
(5) 2 NVIDIA Tesla K40m  cards per node, use resource request "ngpus=[1|2]" and "gpu_model=k40"
(6) Use resource request "ssd=true" to request a chunk with SSD in location /ssd1, /ssd2, and /ssd3 (100GB max each)
(7) Use resource request "nphis=[1|2]" to request phi nodes, the model is Xeon 7120p
~~~

The Palmetto cluster is divided into several "phases",
with each "phase" consisting of compute nodes
equipped with specified hardware.
Within a phase, nodes can communicate data with each other
using specified "interconnect".

To see what nodes in which phases are free,
the `whatsfree` command is available:

Nodes that are "offline" are inacessible to users.

Because you're currently logged in to the
login node, all commands you type in to the shell
are executed there, not on any of the above nodes.
For your commands to be executed on the compute nodes instead,
you will first need to log in to a compute node:
You can do this with the `qsub -I` command:

~~~{.bash}
$ qsub -I
~~~

~~~{.output}
qsub (Warning): Interactive jobs will be treated as not rerunnable
qsub: waiting for job 2725837.pbs02 to start
qsub: job 2725837.pbs02 ready

[username@node1466 ~]$ 
~~~

The prompt indicates that you are no longer
running a shell on the login node (`user001`),
but a compute node (`node1466` or similar).
The `qsub` command is used to submit "jobs"
to the cluster.
A job is a request for cluster resources,
like hardware (like cpu cores, memory, interconnect)
and time (minutes or hours).
The `-I` flag in the `qsub` command stands
for "interactive".
This job is interactive because commands
are entered interactively into a
shell running on a compute node.
(This is opposed to a *batch* job,
in which the commands are included in a script---more
on that later).

Every job you run is associated with a unique job ID
(in the above example, this ID is 2825873).

By default,
`qsub` submits a request for
1 core on 1 compute node with
1 GB of RAM for 30 minutes.
You can request more (or less) of each of these resources
by modifying the `qsub` command.
For instance, to use 2 CPU cores for 10 minutes:

~~~{.bash}
$ qsub -I -l select=1:ncpus=2,walltime=00:10:00
~~~

Here, we use `select=1` to specify the number of
"chunks" of hardware that we'd like.
The following command requests 4 "chunks" of hardware,
with 2 CPU cores, 4 GB of RAM *each* - for 2 minutes:

~~~{.bash}
$ qsub -I -l select=4:ncpus=2:mem=4gb,walltime=00:02:00
~~~

When making requests for resources,
consult `/etc/hardware-table` and the `whatsfree` command.
Note that a "chunk" corresponds to all or part of a node.
So the number of resources per chunk cannot be inconsistent
with the resources actually available.
For example, the below request is invalid,
as nodes on phase 3 only have 8-core CPUs.

~~~{.bash}
$ qsub -I -l select=1:ncpus=16:mem=4gb:phase=3,walltime=00:02:00
~~~

When logged in to a compute node,
you can still edit and move files
in your home and other directories.
