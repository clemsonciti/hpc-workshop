## Nelle's Pipeline: Starting Point

Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist,
has returned from a six-month survey of the
[North Pacific Gyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre),
where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the
[Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch).
She collected 10,000 samples in all, and has run each sample through an assay machine
that measures the abundance of 300 different proteins.
The machine's output for a single sample is
a file with one line for each protein.
For example, the file `NENE01812A.csv` looks like this:

~~~
72,0.142961371327
265,0.452337146655
279,0.332503761597
25,0.557135549292
207,0.55632965303
107,0.96031076351
124,0.662827329632
193,0.814807235075
32,1.82402616061
99,0.7060230697

264,0.552846392611
268,0.0767025200665
~~~

Each line consists of two "fields", separated by a comma (`,`).
The first field identifies the protein,
and the second field is a measure of the amount of protein in the sample.
Nelle needs to accomplish tasks such as the following:

1.  For any given file, extract the amount of a given protein.
2.  Find the maximum amount of a given protein across all files.
3.  For each file, run a program called `stats.py` that she wrote,
    which produces a graph, and writes some statistics
    (these go in the directories `plots/` and `results/` respectively.)

Each file takes about a minute to analyze.
In this lesson,
we'll see how Nelle can use the cluster to perform the above task faster
utilizing her campus HPC resource.
